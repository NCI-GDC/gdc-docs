The ID of each sample will have a specific identifier that depends on the specific project. However, the
codes used in each are the same throughout OCG projects.

The tissue codes in the table above denote the source of tissue collected for study. A patient may under go multiple
tissue collections and/or resected tissue can be separated into smaller portions of material for research, and those
smaller sections may even be preserved using different methods (i.e. some flash frozen vs some with FFPE). Cell lines and
xenografts may also be grown up at different times. Therefore, a letter identifier is added to the tissue code number to
track separate aliquots/tissue sections from the same patient. For example:

            1. A – first aliquot, growth or section of tissue reviewed to meet clinical quality criteria
            2. B – second aliquot, growth or section of tissue reviewed to meet clinical quality criteria

Note: When characterizing multiple tissues from the same case, the sample codes must distinguish between these two types of
tissue by using a separate portion designation (i.e. the tissue codes used could be “01A” and “01B”, etc.)
