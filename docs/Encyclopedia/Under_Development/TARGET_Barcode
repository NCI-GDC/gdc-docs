The ID of each sample will have a specific identifier that depends on the specific project. However, the
codes used in each are the same throughout OCG projects.

The tissue codes in the table above denote the source of tissue collected for study. A patient may under go multiple
tissue collections and/or resected tissue can be separated into smaller portions of material for research, and those
smaller sections may even be preserved using different methods (i.e. some flash frozen vs some with FFPE). Cell lines and
xenografts may also be grown up at different times. Therefore, a letter identifier is added to the tissue code number to
track separate aliquots/tissue sections from the same patient. For example:

            1. A – first aliquot, growth or section of tissue reviewed to meet clinical quality criteria
            2. B – second aliquot, growth or section of tissue reviewed to meet clinical quality criteria

Note: When characterizing multiple tissues from the same case, the sample codes must distinguish between these two types of
tissue by using a separate portion designation (i.e. the tissue codes used could be “01A” and “01B”, etc.)

#Nucleic Acid Codes#
• 01D = DNA, unamplified, from the first isolation of a tissue (fresh/frozen)
• 01E = DNA, unamplified, from the first isolation of a tissue embedded in FFPE
• 01W = DNA, whole genome amplified by Qiagen (one independent reaction)
• 01X=DNA,wholegenomeamplifiedbyQiagen(asecond,separateindependentreaction) • 01Y = DNA, whole genome amplified by Qiagen (pool of “W” and “X” aliquots)
• 01R = RNA, from the first isolation of a tissue (fresh/frozen)
• 01S = RNA, from the first isolation of a tissue embedded in FFPE

Note: If additional isolations are needed from the same tissue aliquot, the # would change to 02D, etc.
#BLGSP: Additional tissue code sample identifiers (when a single tissue yields multiple sample subtypes)#
# Pre-Extraction Manipulation of Tissue Samples (including Cell Sorting):#
Some analyses of patient tissues require certain tissue manipulation prior to nucleic acid extraction. For
example, some OCG tissue samples have undergone a specialized form of handling using flow cytometry called
Fluorescence-activated Cell Sorting (FACS) to separate a heterogeneous mixture of biological cells into two or more
subpopulations, one cell at a time, based upon the specific light scattering and fluorescent characteristics of
each cell type. Therefore, multiple cell types may be available for certain cases. Sorted samples can originate from
and/or result in tumor or normal tissues and will contain an extension of the tissue code following the letter “tissue portion”
identifier (i.e. BLGSP-XX-(USI)-03A.1- 01(D, R, etc.)). From the extension, it is not possible to determine specific
modifications or cell markers used to sort a subpopulation; users must use the metadata files to ascertain specific details
regarding the pre-extraction, post-pathology review handling of tissue. Tissue extension codes use sequential numbers
to denote only that a given sample is unique; the numbers themselves do not provide any additional information on specifics
of the sample.
