# FoundationOne Variant Aggregation and Masking

## Description ##

FoundationOne Variant Aggregation and Masking is a somatic mutation aggregation workflow used in GDC targeted sequencing harmonization.

## Overview ##

FoundationOne Variant Aggregation and Masking is a pipeline used for targeted sequencing somatic mutation aggregation at the GDC. Somatic mutation aggregation is performed with FoundationOne Variant Aggregation and Masking using tumor alignments and generates simple nucleotide variation (SNV) data.

### Input

* Tumor VCF - Targeted Sequencing

### Output

* MAF (Data Type: Aggregated Somatic Mutation)
