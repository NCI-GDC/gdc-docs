# SNP Array-Based Data #
## Description ##

SNP Arrays produce data based on DNA hybridization levels to a set of array probes. Hybridization occurs on the arrays based on the presence or absence of probe-specific SNPs in the chromosome.

## Overview ##

SNP Array-Based data is used at the GDC to perform Copy Number Variation analyses. A copy number segmentation analysis is performed using DNACopy. Chromosomal segments are identified and their copy number are estimated based on similarities between adjacent SNP array probe binding sites<sup>1</sup>.   

### Data Formats ###

The GDC stores processed SNP Array-Based data in the active harmonized portal. They are stored as tab-delimited copy number segmentation files, which identify the segment regions and their estimated copy number.
