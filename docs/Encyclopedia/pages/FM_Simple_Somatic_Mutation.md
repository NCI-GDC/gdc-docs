# FM Simple Somatic Mutation

## Description ##

The FM (Foundation Medicine) Simple Somatic Mutation (SSM) workflow is a genomic profile harmonization workflow in the GDC for identifying simple somatic mutations in targeted sequencing data.

## Overview ##

FM Simple Somatic Mutation is the pipeline used for genomic profile harmonization for the FM-AD project at the GDC. Genomic profile harmonization is performed by lifting over simple nucleotide variation data from uploaded genomic profile data.

### Input

* Submitted sequencing reads

### Output

* VCF (Data Type: Raw Simple Somatic Mutation)
