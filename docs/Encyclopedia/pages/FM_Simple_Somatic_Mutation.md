# FM Simple Somatic Mutation

## Description ##

FM (Foundation Medicine) Simple Somatic Mutation (SSM) workflow is a genomic profile harmonization workflow in the GDC for identifying simple somatic mutations in targeted sequencing data.

## Overview ##

FM Simple Somatic Mutation is one of the pipelines used for genomic profile harmonization at the GDC. Genomic profile harmonization is performed with FM Simple Somatic Mutation using tumor alignments and generates simple nucleotide variation data.

### Input

Submitted sequencing reads

### Output

* VCF (Data Type: Raw Simple Somatic Mutation)
