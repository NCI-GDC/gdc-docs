# Pindel

## Description ##

Pindel is a somatic variant calling pipeline used in GDC whole genome sequencing (WGS), whole exome sequencing (WXS) and targeted sequencing harmonization.

## Overview ##

Pindel is one of the pipelines used for WGS, WXS and targeted sequencing somatic variant calling at the GDC. Somatic variant calling is performed with Pindel using tumor and normal alignments and generates simple nucleotide variation (SNV) data.

### Input

* Tumor BAM - WGS, WXS or Targeted Sequencing
* Normal BAM - WGS, WXS or Targeted Sequencing

### Output

* VCF (Data Type: Raw Simple Somatic Mutation)
