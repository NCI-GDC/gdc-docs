# BWA-aln

## Description ##

BWA-aln is an alignment workflow used in GDC miRNA-Seq data harmonization. BWA is an alignment algorithm that is used to align read groups to the reference genome.

## Overview ##

BWA-aln is a BWA based alignment workflow for miRNA-Seq. BWA-aln is used for aligning sequence reads to a reference genome for both normal and tumor tissues with BWA algorithm.

### Input

* Submitted sequencing reads

### Output

* BAM (Data Type: Aligned Reads)
