# BWA-aln

## Description ##

BWA-aln is a sequencing alignment and quality improvement workflow used in the GDC miRNA-Seq data harmonization. 

## Overview ##

BWA-aln is a BWA based alignment workflow for miRNA-Seq. BWA-aln is used for aligning sequence reads to a reference genome for both normal and tumor tissues.

### Input

Submitted sequencing reads

### Output

* BAM (Data Type: Aligned Reads)
