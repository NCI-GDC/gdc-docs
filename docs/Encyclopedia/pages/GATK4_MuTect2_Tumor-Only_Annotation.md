# GATK4 MuTect2 Tumor-Only Annotation

## Description ##

GATK4 MuTect2 Tumor-Only Annotation is a workflow used in GDC whole exome sequencing (WXS) and targeted sequencing harmonization.


## Overview ##

GATK4 MuTect2 Tumor-Only Annotation is a workflow utilized in the GDC for annotating somatic variants identified in tumor-only whole exome sequencing (WXS) and targeted sequencing data. 

### Input

* Tumor VCF - WXS or Targeted Sequencing

### Output

* VCF (Data Type: Annotated Somatic Mutation)
* MAF (Data Type: Annotated Somatic Mutation)
