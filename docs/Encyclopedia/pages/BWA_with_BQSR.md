# BWA with BQSR

## Description ##

BWA with BQSR (Base Quality Score Recalibration) is a sequencing alignment and quality improvement workflow used in the GDC targeted sequencing data harmonization. 

## Overview ##

BWA with BQSR is a BWA based alignment workflow for targeted sequencing with additional step of Base Quality Score Recalibration (BQSR). BWA with BQSR is used for aligning sequence reads to a reference genome for tumor tissues only.

### Input

Submitted sequencing reads

### Output

* BAM (Data Type: Aligned Reads)
