# GATK4 MuTect2 Tumor-Only

## Description ##

GATK4 MuTect2 Tumor-Only is a somatic variant calling pipeline utilized in the GDC for analyzing tumor-only whole exome sequencing (WXS) and targeted sequencing data. 

## Overview ##

GATK4 MuTect2 Tumor-Only is a pipeline used for WXS and targeted sequencing somatic variant calling at the GDC. Somatic variant calling is performed with GATK4 MuTect2 Tumor-Only using tumor alignments and generates single nucleotide variants (SNVs) data.

### Input

* Tumor BAM - WXS or Targeted Sequencing

### Output

* VCF (Data Type: Raw Simple Somatic Mutation)
