# Pindel Annotation

## Description ##

Pindel Annotation is a somatic mutation annotation pipeline used in GDC whole exome sequencing (WXS) and targeted sequencing harmonization.

## Overview ##

Pindel Annotation is a pipeline used for WXS and targeted sequencing somatic mutation annotation at the GDC. Somatic mutation annotation is performed with Pindel Annotation using tumor and normal alignments and generates simple nucleotide variation (SNV) data.


### Input

* Tumor VCF - WXS or Targeted Sequencing
* Normal VCF - WXS or Targeted Sequencing

### Output

* MAF (Data Type: Annotated Somatic Mutation)
* VCF (Data Type: Annotated Somatic Mutation)
