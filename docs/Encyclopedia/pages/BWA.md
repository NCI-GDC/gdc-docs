# BWA

## Description ##

BWA is the alignment tool that the GDC uses to build a few alignment workflows with subtle changes.

(?) I'm not sure I understand it correctly. another option:

BWA is a sequencing alignment and quality improvement workflow used in the GDC miRNA-Seq data harmonization. 

## Overview ##

BWA is a part of the Alignment Workflow. BWA is used for aligning sequence reads to a reference genome for both normal and tumor tissues.   

### Input

Submitted sequencing reads

### Output

* BAM (Data Type: Aligned Reads)
