### Known Issues and Workarounds

* __Section 508 Accessibility__:
    * There are known Section 508 accessibility issues that the GDC plans to address in subsequent releases. If a user encounters a Section 508 barrier, please contact GDC Support (support@nci-gdc.datacommons.io) for assistance. Known Section 508 issues are identified below.
        * There are keyboard focus and navigation issues in analysis tools that use popup windows/overlays for custom user selections. Impacted analysis tools include BAM Slicing, Sequence Reads, Gene Expression Clustering, OncoMatrix, and ProteinPaint.
        * Heatmaps within the Sequence Reads tool do not contain concise alternative text or equivalent alternatives.
        * In the Gene Expression Clustering tool and OncoMatrix, there are no headers for genes, clusters, and/or cases in the heatmap.
        * In the Gene Expression Clustering tool, color is used to convey gene expression values but there are no patterns to convey the same information as color. Color is also used in ProteinPaint and the Sequence Reads tool to convey consequence type but there are no distinguishing patterns.
        * Some text can be difficult to read on a small screen at a 200% zoom level.
        * No notification is provided to warn logged-in users of an upcoming timeout due to inactivity. <!--PEAR-2263-->
* __Survival Plot__:
    * In Mutation Frequency, the downloaded image may display a survival curve when none is plotted within the portal. <!--SV-2356-->
    * When the survival plot is zoomed in and an image is downloaded, the curves within the image may extend beyond the y-axis. <!--SV-2348-->
* __Cohort MAF__:
    * A downloaded file may be corrupted if the server data processing is terminated after 5 minutes in order to conserve server resources.
    There will be a red banner above the MAF controls to indicate the termination.
* Using multiple browser tabs with the portal when adding or removing files from the __Cart__ may result in the Cart not being updated as expected. <!--SV-2412-->
* In the __files, cases, and annotations tables__, the case ID search field is case-sensitive. If the search does not return the expected results, try changing the input to uppercase as case IDs are most commonly uppercased.
* __Cohorts__ filtered by mutated genes and SSMs not in those genes will result in 0 cases since the mutations have to belong to those particular genes in order to match cases for the results. As a workaround, first filter the cohort by the mutated genes and export the cohort using the Export Cohort feature in the Cohort Bar. Then, reimport the cohort using the Import New Cohort feature before applying the SSM filters. <!--SV-2331/PEAR-1616-->
* The case count displayed above the table in the __Repository__ can be incorrect when applying filters based on samples (e.g. Tissue Type) or input files. <!--SV-2260-->
* The __Slide Image Viewer__ will display a black image temporarily if a user zooms in on a slide then switches to another slide. <!--SV-2370-->
* The TSV of the __Most Frequent Somatic Mutations__ table in the __Case Summary Page__ does not reflect the displayed information in the table if a search filter has been applied. <!--PEAR-2143-->
* Repeated and consecutive uses of the browser's back and/or forward buttons to return to a previously viewed page may result in a different page being displayed than the one indicated in the browser address bar. <!--SV-2552-->

    * Allow users to modify colors from the legend.
* __Gene Expression Clustering__:
    * Avoids showing genes with no expression values (due to an issue of ProteinPaint GENCODE v36 data that affects only certain genes; data issue will be fixed at the next release).
    * Make zscore transformation a checkbox option in Clustering menu.
* __Cohort MAF__:
    * Allow users to sort the table of MAF files.

        * No notification is provided to warn logged-in users of an upcoming timeout due to inactivity. <!--PEAR-2263-->
* __Survival Plot__:
    * Survival plots are generated from the `diagnoses.days_to_last_follow_up` field. For some TCGA projects, in Data Release 42, data was migrated to the `follow_ups.days_to_follow_up` field. This resulted in an issue with missing cases for some TCGA projects in survival plots. The GDC is actively working on a fix. In the interim, users should create survival plots using the greatest value in the `follow_ups.days_to_follow_up` field. <!-- SV-2584 -->
    * In Mutation Frequency, the downloaded image may display a survival curve when none is plotted within the portal. <!--SV-2356-->
    * When the survival plot is zoomed in and an image is downloaded, the curves within the image may extend beyond the y-axis. <!--SV-2348-->
* __Gene Expression Clustering__:
    * The tool allows deleting the gene expression group and displays an uninformative error message after submitting the deletion.
* __Cohort MAF__:
    * A downloaded file may be corrupted if the server data processing is terminated after 5 minutes in order to conserve server resources.
    There will be a red banner above the MAF controls to indicate the termination.
* In __ProteinPaint__, the "Gene Expression" option is non-functional when filtering samples in a sub-track.
* Using multiple browser tabs with the portal when adding or removing files from the __Cart__ may result in the Cart not being updated as expected. <!--SV-2412-->
* In the __files, cases, and annotations tables__, the case ID search field is case-sensitive. If the search does not return the expected results, try changing the input to uppercase as case IDs are most commonly uppercased.

* The __Slide Image Viewer__ will display a black image temporarily if a user zooms in on a slide then switches to another slide. <!--SV-2370-->
* The TSV of the __Most Frequent Somatic Mutations__ table in the __Case Summary Page__ does not reflect the displayed information in the table if a search filter has been applied. <!--PEAR-2143-->

### Known Issues and Workarounds

* __Section 508 Accessibility__:
    * There are known Section 508 accessibility issues that the GDC plans to address in subsequent releases. If a user encounters a Section 508 barrier, please contact GDC Support (support@nci-gdc.datacommons.io) for assistance. Known Section 508 issues are identified below.
        * There are keyboard focus and navigation issues in analysis tools that use popup windows/overlays for custom user selections. Impacted analysis tools include BAM Slicing, Sequence Reads, Gene Expression Clustering, OncoMatrix, and ProteinPaint.
        * Heatmaps within the Sequence Reads tool do not contain concise alternative text or equivalent alternatives.
        * In the Gene Expression Clustering tool and OncoMatrix, there are no headers for genes, clusters, and/or cases in the heatmap.
        * In the Gene Expression Clustering tool, color is used to convey gene expression values but there are no patterns to convey the same information as color. Color is also used in ProteinPaint and the Sequence Reads tool to convey consequence type but there are no distinguishing patterns.
        * Some text can be difficult to read on a small screen at a 200% zoom level.
* __Survival Plot__:
    * In Mutation Frequency, the downloaded image may display a survival curve when none is plotted within the portal. <!--SV-2356-->
    * When the survival plot is zoomed in and an image is downloaded, the curves within the image may extend beyond the y-axis. <!--SV-2348-->
* __Gene Expression Clustering__:
    * The tool allows deleting the gene expression group and displays an uninformative error message after submitting the deletion.
* In __ProteinPaint__, the "Gene Expression" option is non-functional when filtering samples in a sub-track.
* Adding family_histories.relationship_age_at_diagnosis or follow_ups.other_clinical_attributes.undescended_testis_corrected_age_range as a custom filter in the __Cohort Builder__ will result in endless spinners being displayed on these filter cards. To remove these cards, close the browser tab and return to the portal. <!--SV-2532-->
* Using multiple browser tabs with the portal when adding or removing files from the __Cart__ may result in the Cart not being updated as expected. <!--SV-2412-->
* In the __files, cases, and annotations tables__, the case ID search field is case-sensitive. If the search does not return the expected results, try changing the input to uppercase as case IDs are most commonly uppercased.
* __Cohorts__ filtered by mutated genes and SSMs not in those genes will result in 0 cases since the mutations have to belong to those particular genes in order to match cases for the results. As a workaround, first filter the cohort by the mutated genes and export the cohort using the Export Cohort feature in the Cohort Bar. Then, reimport the cohort using the Import New Cohort feature before applying the SSM filters. <!--SV-2331/PEAR-1616-->
* The __Slide Image Viewer__ will display a black image temporarily if a user zooms in on a slide then switches to another slide. <!--SV-2370-->
* The TSV of the __Most Frequent Somatic Mutations__ table in the __Case Summary Page__ does not reflect the displayed information in the table if a search filter has been applied. <!--PEAR-2143-->
* Repeated and consecutive uses of the browser's back and/or forward buttons to return to a previously viewed page may result in a different page being displayed than the one indicated in the browser address bar. <!--SV-2552-->

### Known Issues and Workarounds

* __Section 508 Accessibility__:
    * There are known Section 508 accessibility issues that the GDC plans to address in subsequent releases. If a user encounters a Section 508 barrier, please contact GDC Support (support@nci-gdc.datacommons.io) for assistance. Known Section 508 issues are identified below.
        * There are keyboard focus and navigation issues in analysis tools that use popup windows/overlays for custom user selections. Impacted analysis tools include BAM Slicing, Sequence Reads, Gene Expression Clustering, OncoMatrix, and ProteinPaint.
        * Heatmaps within the Sequence Reads tool do not contain concise alternative text or equivalent alternatives. Additionally, equivalent alternatives to the Box plots, QQ plots, Venn diagrams, and the body plot on the home page are not available.
        * In the Gene Expression Clustering tool and OncoMatrix, there are no headers for genes, clusters, and/or cases in the heatmap.
        * In the Gene Expression Clustering tool, color is used to convey gene expression values but there are no patterns to convey the same information as color. Color is also used in ProteinPaint and the Sequence Reads tool to convey consequence type but there are no distinguishing patterns.
        * Some text can be difficult to read on a small screen at a 200% zoom level.
* __Cohorts__:
    * Cohorts are under active development and their behavior may change in the first several months after the release of GDC Portal 2.0. As this process may result in the loss of saved cohorts on the portal, we highly recommend [exporting cohorts](/Data_Portal/Users_Guide/getting_started.md#main-toolbar) locally.
    * Cohorts created based on CNV losses or gains may not have the correct composition when filtered by additional mutated genes. As a workaround, first filter by the mutated genes before creating cohorts based on CNV losses and gains.
    * Cohorts filtered by mutated genes and SSMs not in those genes may unexpectedly result in 0 cases. <!--SV-2331/PEAR-1616-->
    * Cohorts containing FM-AD cases may not update correctly when users with dbGaP access to FM-AD (phs001179) log in or out. As a workaround, logging in before creating cohorts with FM-AD cases is recommended. <!--SV-2389-->
* __Survival Plot__:
    * The survival plot in Cohort Comparison does not display text indicating that there is insufficient survival data to plot. <!--SV-2357-->
    * In Mutation Frequency, the downloaded image may display a survival curve when none is plotted within the portal. <!--SV-2356-->
    * When the survival plot is zoomed in and an image is downloaded, the curves within the image may extend beyond the y-axis. <!--SV-2348-->
* __Cart__:
    * Spinners on the Download Cart and Download Associated Data buttons may be displayed longer than expected. This is a visual issue and does not affect the use of these buttons. <!--SV-2343-->
    * Using multiple browser tabs with the portal when adding or removing files from the cart may result in the cart not being updated as expected. <!--SV-2412-->
* The aggregated MAF generated using the __Cohort Level MAF__ tool is missing the tumor_bam_uuid column. The tumor_sample_uuid and case_id should be used for reproducibility until the tumor_bam_uuid has been added.
* In both the __Sequence Reads__ and __BAM Slicing Download__ tools, the number of available BAM files may be overcounted when a cohort filter is in use.
* Gene/mutation sets created from the tables in the __Mutation Frequency__ tool may contain 0 genes/mutations if the cohort has Available Data filters or Biospecimen filters. <!--SV-2314-->
* The TSV of the __cases table__ may not contain the expected tabs. <!--DEV-2324-->
* In the Repository and cases table, the case ID search field is case-sensitive. If the search does not return the expected results, try changing the input to uppercase as case IDs are most commonly uppercased.
* When the __Cohort Comparison__ tool is loading, the loading spinner may be displayed above the other areas of the Analysis Center. <!--SV-2360-->
* The __Slide Image Viewer__ will display a black image temporarily if a user zooms in on a slide then switches to another slide. <!--SV-2370-->

## Release 2.0.0

* __GDC Product__: GDC Data Portal
* __Release Date__:  February 8, 2024

### New Features and Changes

GDC 2.0 is a major update to the original GDC Data Portal introduced in 2016. This latest version adopts a "cohort-centric" workflow, in which users build custom sets of cases to analyze, and introduces several new analysis tools. New features of GDC 2.0 include:

* A cohort-centric workflow in which a cohort is first built and then analyzed using tools on the Data Portal. All of these functionalities can be reached from the Analysis Center.  
    * This includes a toolbar, that can be used to view or modify an existing cohort while using any analysis tool.
* Core tools that compose the main functionalities of the GDC Data Portal:
    * __Cohort Builder:__ Build a cohort of cases using clinical and biospecimen properties
    * __Repository:__ Download files based on a specific cohort
    * __Projects:__ Browse, filter, and create cohorts based on GDC projects
* Analysis tools that analyze specific cohorts:
    * __Mutation Frequency:__ Analyze somatic mutations that were called in the WXS and Targeted Sequencing pipelines and their associated genes
    * __Clinical Data Analysis:__ Analyze and visualize clinical data associated with your cohort
    * __Cohort Comparison:__ Analyze the properties of multiple cohorts
    * __Set Operations:__ Display a Venn diagram and compare/contrast cohorts or gene/mutation sets
    * __BAM Slicing Download:__ Download a specific region of a BAM file created by the GDC
    * __ProteinPaint:__ Visualize somatic mutations on a specific linear gene or chromosomal region
    * __Gene Expression Clustering:__ Visualizes gene expression clustering for a specific cohort
    * __Sequence Reads:__ Visualize the reads within a specific BAM file
    * __OncoMatrix:__ Visualize the most commonly mutated genes across a cohort

### Bugs Fixed Since Last Release

Not applicable as this is the initial release of GDC 2.0.

### Known Issues and Workarounds

* __Section 508 Accessibility__:
    * There are known Section 508 accessibility issues that the GDC plans to address in subsequent releases. If a user encounters a Section 508 barrier, please contact GDC Support (support@nci-gdc.datacommons.io) for assistance. Known Section 508 issues are identified below.

    * If removing gene/mutation filters from a cohort temporarily results in 0 cases, cohorts may not display data in Mutation Frequency, Cohort Builder, and the summary charts. As a workaround, remove the gene and mutation filters, then add them back. <!--SV-2414-->
* __Survival Plot__:
    * The survival plot in Cohort Comparison does not display text indicating that there is insufficient survival data to plot. <!--SV-2357-->
    * The survival plot in Mutation Frequency may flicker when the cohort has 0 cases. <!--SV-2331/PEAR-1701-->

    * When the survival plot is zoomed in and an image is downloaded, the curves within the image may extend beyond the y-axis. <!--SV-2348-->
* __Cart__:
    * Spinners on the Download Cart and Download Associated Data buttons may be displayed longer than expected. This is a visual issue and does not affect the use of these buttons. <!--SV-2343-->
    * More than 5 GB of files in total may be downloaded at a time via the browser if the user first attempts to download controlled access data without being logged in, then logs in via the information dialog displayed before continuing with the download. <!--SV-2342-->
    * Using multiple browser tabs with the portal when adding or removing files from the cart may result in the cart not being updated as expected. <!--SV-2412-->
* __Mutation Frequency__:
    * Gene/mutation sets created from the tables in Mutation Frequency may contain 0 genes/mutations if the cohort has Available Data filters or Biospecimen filters. <!--SV-2314-->
    * Attempting to download a TSV of all the mutations in the GDC may result in an error due to the length of time needed to generate the TSV. As a workaround, limit the number of mutations downloaded to 1.5 million. <!--SV-2388-->
* __Main Toolbar__:
    * Attempting to download the **Clinical/Biospecimen TSV or JSON** before the cohort has fully loaded may result in an error. <!--SV-2402-->
    * The TSV of the **cases table** may not contain the expected tabs. <!--DEV-2324-->
* __OncoMatrix__:
    * Manually deleting all genes will result in an error message "Error: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'lst')". The user can close and re-open OncoMatrix for use.
    * Dragging genes only works once. After one gene is dragged to a new position, no genes can be dragged to new positions.
    * In OncoMatrix, the cases may not get re-sorted as expected after a certain sequence of actions
* __ProteinPaint__:
    * A nested filter may be constructed for a Lollipop subtrack, e.g. sex=male AND ( primarysite=aa OR disease=bb ), but cannot be translated into GDC cohort filters. The translation code has a preliminary implementation that only works for "flat" filters without nesting.
    * Cohorts cannot be created using the Create Cohort button in ProteinPaint for a single sample
    * In ProteinPaint, the total number of samples in a category breakdown and the total number of samples in the sunburst ring are not based on a user's current cohort
    * In ProteinPaint, when clicking on a sunburst ring, the sample table is not showing up
    * In ProteinPaint, a Disco plot launched from the sunburst ring can show "undefined" in the plot header
    * A ProteinPaint plot launched from OncoMatrix and Gene Expression Clustering does not observe the current cohort and displays mutated cases for all GDC
* In the __Gene Expression Clustering__ tool, if any part of the dendrogram is selected and the current cohort is modified, then the new dendrogram will render with scattered subtrees selected.
* The "A" in the Allele Summary text is cut off in the __Sequence Reads__ tool.
* __Quick Search__ may not display results if the same search input is applied twice quickly. As a workaround, temporarily change the input before reentering the intended search. <!--SV-2410-->
* Filters related to numeric values may display a smaller number than what the user entered within the __Cohort Builder__. This is a visual issue and does not affect the filters applied to the cohort. <!--SV-2383-->
* When the __Cohort Comparison__ tool is loading, the loading spinner may be displayed above the other areas of the Analysis Center. <!--SV-2360-->
* The __Repository__ tool may display an incorrect file size total of 0 bytes when filtering is applied within the tool and the active cohort contains Available Data filters. <!--SV-2376-->
* The __Slide Image Viewer__ will display a black image temporarily if a user zooms in on a slide then switches to another slide. <!--SV-2370-->
* In __Set Operations__, the saving of gene and mutation sets may be unsuccessful if the saving dialog is manually dismissed after the Save button is clicked. <!--SV-2368-->
* Clicking the X button on the __Unexpected Error dialog box__ does not dismiss it. The workaround is to click the OK button. <!--SV-2367-->

* Fixed bug where clicking the # of Affected Cases denominator on the Gene page's Most Frequent Somatic Mutations table displayed an incorrect number of Cases.

### Known Issues and Workarounds

*  Pre-release Data Portal login is not supported on Internet Explorer or the last version of Edge (42).  Edge 41 does login successfully.
*  Custom Facet Filters
    * Some definitions are missing from the property list when adding custom facet file or case filters. <!--SV-989-->
*  Visualizations
    *  SIFT and PolyPhen annotations are missing from the export JSON of the mutation table. They are present in the export TSV. <!--PRTL-1990-->

## Release 1.8.0

* __GDC Product__: GDC Data Portal
* __Release Date__: August 22, 2017

### New Features and Changes

Major features/changes:

* A feature that links the exploration and repository pages was added. For example:
    - In the exploration page, cases with a specific mutation could be selected. This set could then be linked to the repository page to download the data files associated with these cases.
    - In the repository menu, the user can select cases associated with specific files. The set could then be linked to exploration page to view the variants associated with this set of cases.

*  Users can now upload a custom gene list to the exploration page and leverage the GDC search and visualization features for cases and variants associated with the gene set.

*  Filters added for the gene entity page. For example:
    - Clicking on a mutated gene from the project page will display mutations associated with the gene that are present in this project (filtered protein viewer, etc.).
    - Clicking on a mutated gene from the exploration page will display the mutations associated with the gene filtered by additional search criteria, such as "primary site is Kidney and mutation impact is high".

* UUIDs are now hidden from tables and charts to simplify readability. The UUIDs can still be exported and viewed in the tables using the "arrange columns" feature. In the mutation table, UUIDs are automatically exported.

* Mutation entity page - one consequence per transcript is shown (10 rows by default) in the consequence table. The user should display all rows before exporting the table.

### Bugs Fixed Since Last Release
*  Exploration
    *  Combining "Variant Caller" mutation filter with a case filter will display incorrect counts in the mutation facet. The number of mutations in the resulting mutation table is correct. <!-- API-307 -->
    *  Mutation table: it is difficult to click on the denominator in "#Affected Cases in Cohort" column displayed to the left side of the bar. The user should click at a specific position at the top of the number to be able to go to the corresponding link. <!-- PRTL-1377 -->


### Known Issues and Workarounds
*  Visualizations
    *  Data Portal graphs cannot be exported as PNG images in Internet Explorer. Graphs can be exported in PNG or SVG format from Chrome or Firefox browsers <!-- PRTL-1325 / PRTL-1114 -->. Internet Explorer does not display chart legend and title when re-opening previously downloaded SVG files, the recommendation is to open downloaded SVG files with another program.

## Release 1.3.0

* __GDC Product__: GDC Data Portal
* __Release Date__: September 7, 2016

### New Features and Changes

*   A new "Metadata" button on the cart page to download merged clinical, biospecimen, and file metadata in a single consolidated JSON file. **May require clearing browser cache** <!-- PRTL-177 -->
*   Added a banner on the Data Portal to help users find data <!-- PRTL-237 -->
*   Added support for "Enter" key on login button <!-- PRTL-136 -->
*   On the Data page, the browser will remember which facet tab was selected when hitting the "Back" button <!-- PRTL-147 -->
*   In file entity page, if there is a link to one single file, redirect to this file's entity page instead of a list page.  <!-- PRTL-75 -->


### Bugs Fixed Since Last Release

* 	Adding a mix of open and controlled files to the cart from any Case entity pages was creating authorization issues <!-- PRTL-226 -->
*  Opening multiple browser tabs and adding files in those browser tabs was not refreshing the cart in other tabs. <!-- PRTL-181 -->
*   When user logs in from the advanced search page, the login popup does not automatically close <!-- PRTL-88 -->
*   When removing a file from the cart and clicking undo, GDC loses track of permission status of the user towards this file and will ask for the user to log-in again. <!-- PGDC-2496 -->
*   Download File Metadata button produces incomplete JSON output omitting such fields as file_name and submitter_id.  The current workaround includes using the API to return file metadata. <!-- SV-359 / PRTL-177 -->    
*   Annotations notes do not wrap to the next line at the beginning or the end of a word, some words might be split in two lines <!-- PGDC-2474 / PRTL-182-->   
*   Sorting annotations by Case UUID causes error <!-- PRTL-95 -->   

### Known Issues and Workarounds

*   General
    *   When no filters are engaged in the Legacy Archive or Data Portal, clicking the Download Manifest button may produce a 500 error and the message "We are currently experiencing issues. Please try again later.".  To avoid this error the user can first filter by files or cases to reduce the number files added to the manifest.
    *   After successful authentication, the authentication popup does not close for Internet Explorer users running in "Compatibility View". Workaround is to uncheck "Display Intranet sites in Compatibility View" in Internet Explorer options.

### Known Issues and Workarounds

*   General.
    *   After successful authentication, the authentication popup does not close for Internet Explorer users running in "Compatibility View". This only impact users at the NIH. Workaround is to uncheck "Display Intranet sites in Compatibility View" in Internet Explorer options. Alternatively, refreshing the portal will correctly display authentication status.
    *   Download SRA XML files from the legacy archive portal might not be possible in some context <!-- PGDC-2457 --> <!-- PGDC-2469 -->  
    *   Not possible to use the browser's back button after hitting a 404 page <!-- PGDC-2429 -->
    *   404 page missing from Legacy Archive Portal <!-- PGDC-2477 -->
    *   Table widget icon and export JSON icon should be different <!-- PGDC-2446 -->     
*   Data and facets

    *   Table sorting icon does not include numbers <!-- PGDC-35 -->    
    *   '--' symbol is missing on empty fields (blank instead), additional missing fields identified since last release.  <!-- PGDC-2447 -->    
*   Cart
    *   When removing a file from the cart and clicking undo, GDC looses track of permission status of the user towards this file and will ask for the user to log-in again. <!-- PGDC-2496 -->     
    *   Counts displayed in the top right of the screen, next to the Cart icon, might get inconsistent if files are removed from the server. <!-- PGDC-2403 -->
*   Annotations
    *   Annotations notes do not wrap to the next line at the beginning or the end of a word, some words might be split in two lines <!-- PGDC-2474 -->
*   Web Browsers
    *   Browsers limit the number of concurrent downloads, it is generally recommended to add files to the cart and download large number of files through the GDC Data Transfer Tool, more details can be found on [GDC Website](https://gdc.cancer.gov/about-gdc/gdc-faqs).
    *   Internet Explorer users are not able to use the "Only show fields with no values" when adding custom facets <!-- PGDC-2467 -->
    *   The GDC Portals are not compatible with Internet Explorer running in compatibility mode. Workaround is to disable compatibilty mode <!-- PGDC-2480 -->

Workaround is to uncheck "Display Intranet sites in Compatibility View" in Internet Explorer options. Alternatively, refreshing the portal will correctly display authentication status.
