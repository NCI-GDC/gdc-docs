# Quick Start Page

The purpose of this guide is to quickly introduce researchers to the GDC Data Portal. This is not a comprehensive overview of the Data Portal and may not contain details for your specific use-case. Please see the rest of the Data Portal documentation pages for information about specific tools.

Start at [https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/](https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/).

### Building and Analyzing a Cohort


__Step 1:__ Go to the Cohort Builder at the top left of the Data Portal.

__Step 4:__ The cohort you created is now your active cohort.  Go to the Analysis Center at the top left of the Data Portal.  Choose the tool you would like to use from the list.  The analysis will apply to the data from your cohort.
